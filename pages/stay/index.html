                time is running out.
                            <br/>
                consistently,
                            <br/>
                the drip-drip-drip
                            <br/>
                of water against rock,
                            <br/>
                eroding a spot for itself.
                            <br/>
                the slow immersion of
                            <br/>
                land into sea,
                            <br/>
                as tendrils of saltwater
                            <br/>
                creep closer to habitation.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                do you think the earth
                            <br/>
                spends moments wondering
                            <br/>
                about how it will cease to exist?
                            <br/>
                do you think the turtles
                            <br/>
                discuss amongst themselves,
                            <br/>
                coming up with theories
                            <br/>
                about the apocalypse?
                            <br/>
                do you think a draining life
                            <br/>
                spends its final days
                            <br/>
                worrying about the last breath?
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                even as you love,
                            <br/>
                why are you thinking about the end?
                            <br/>
                the split second where
                            <br/>
                you are bereft,
                            <br/>
                unmoored,
                            <br/>
                alone.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                when you look back
                            <br/>
                on these moments,
                            <br/>
                it is not the warmth of
                            <br/>
                being held,
                            <br/>
                but the fear of losing
                            <br/>
                that rears its head.
                            <br/>
                and slowly, every memory
                            <br/>
                is tainted by the possibility of loss.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                but loss does not lessen
                            <br/>
                the more you think about it.
                            <br/>
                there is no crash course,
                            <br/>
                no preparatory weeks
                            <br/>
                to absorb the impact.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                when loss hits,
                            <br/>
                as it eventually must,
                            <br/>
                you will stumble.
                            <br/>
                you will feel as if
                            <br/>
                the earth has been ripped out
                            <br/>
                from under you.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                but what tides you through,
                            <br/>
                are the memories of love.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                to love and to lose,
                            <br/>
                they say.
                            <br/>
                for it is one that helps the other.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                so if you are constantly
                            <br/>
                thinking about letting go,
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                why would you bother holding on at all?
                <br>
                <br>
